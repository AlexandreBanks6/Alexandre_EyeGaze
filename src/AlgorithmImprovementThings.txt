Things to try:
- Look into dist cell, how it corresponds to the calibration functions (either recording distance for each polynomial
and then weighting the distance as well, or scaling the PG vectors to match the initial polynomial)
- Filter the compensated POG
- Take the last 80% of PG vectors for every target (for training)
- Take the 1-dot data from 1second upwards
- Run compensation on average and not just individual right/left POGs
- Maybe get average eye corner location for each pupil direction?
- Look at my old approach, and the training data am I scaling the PG vectors?

1) Create a 'DataCollection_ParticipantList.csv' file in the main data directory where the converted data is
2) Run 'CollectedData_RenamerAndConverter.py' to rename all the files which we will process to the order specified in 'DataCollection_ParticipantList.csv'
3) Run 'Data_Merger_eyeNdi.m' to merge the eye gaze data and Ndi data and also to extract only the calibration points
4) Run 'EyeGaze_Main_Aug9.py' to run the eye corner tracking algorithm and save the eye corner locations as a pdf as well
5) Run 'Data_Merger_corners.m' to merge the corner data with the NDI and eye gaze data
6) Run the appropriate head compensation tracking pipeline (e.g. V2_HeadCompensation_Interpolation.m) or another of our choice
